A repository for our group project
*****

Our group project is to create a website that introduces secondary school students to the fundamentals of information, computer and network security. 

The site should give students -
  an understanding of security mechanisms that can protect information systems
  an understanding of the issues around privacy in business information systems
  an appreciation of techniques for mitigating privacy threats through appropriate security controls
